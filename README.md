This code corresponds to the code used in the work published at DOI: XXXXX

Code must be run from 1 to 5, but unless the original data is obtained from the sources, it will be required to start from script 2 onwards, since the original data is here not updated, only the cleaned version of it. 

Any doubt with it, please contact cescgordo@posteo.eu
